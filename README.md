## PNG overlay setup

Place your panel image at `public/assets/omnichord.png` (the app loads it at runtime).
Use the Debug Overlay toggle to verify hit areas line up with the image.

## Quick start

1. Tap **Enable Audio** (required by iOS Safari).
2. Tap/hold chord buttons to sustain.
3. Swipe across the strumplate to play harp tones.
4. Use **Stop All** as a panic button.

## Local dev

Run a static server (for example: `python -m http.server`) and open `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.
